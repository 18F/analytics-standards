This project memorializes the standards that 18F sets for itself for implementing various forms of analytics, namely website analytics but also api analytics.  


## 18F Team Standards for Website Analytics 

Every project that has a digital presence will integrate appropriate analytics to better learn what our users need and want.  Webpages should integrate both the 18F Google Analytics as well as the Digital Analytics Program (DAP).  Web services should integrate the `api.data.gov` service.  

Every 18F team member should be given read/collaborate access to the 18F Google Analytics account in the first two weeks on the job.  At the same time, they should be informed of the process for gaining access to the Digital Analytics Program and GSA's Google Analytics account.
