### Can I give access to a project's analytics to a client?  

Yes, please!  Not only can you, but you should!  

### How do I give access to a project's analytics to a client?  

 In order to grant them access, we need to know what email address they want to use. If it is not a gmail (or google apps) email address, then they need to first go to google.com/analytics and create an account there using their preferred email address.

Then post in `#g-analytics` on Slack the email addresses of the client staff who you want to give access.  If you're not the project lead, make sure they are aware by cc'ing them in the slack post. 

They will be given `Collaborate` and `Read & Analyze` permissions specific only to their project and will receive an email notification.

It is incumbent on the project team to track when analytics access should be removed. If a partner moves on and should no longer have access, the 18F team needs to contact #g-analytics on Slack and specify that access should be rescinded.

_Note that we are not currently in a position to grant access to Digital Analytics Program data to 3rd parties._
