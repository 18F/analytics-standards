### What is the difference between 18F Google Analytics and the Digital Analytics Program (DAP)?

The [Digital Analytics Program](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) and 18F Google Analytics are different services with two distinct code snippets. 18F projects should participate in both services.

##### Digital Analytics Program
The [Digital Analytics Program](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) is a shared service available to all federal agencies to provides website analytics. DAP both offers a fully functional analytics service to agencies but also integrates with a cross-government combined analytics dashboard.  Staff at participating agencies are able to access the full, government-wide data.

Furthermore, the Digital Analytics Program offers government agencies services such as guidance, training, and web analytics tools.  Government sites including 18F sites can be added to the DAP Google Analytics account via a code snippet.

##### 18F Google Analytics
18F Google Analytics is an account only for 18F websites. Since 18F is the owner of the account it allows us to make special modifications not avaiable through the DAP. To add a new 18F site to our Google Anaytics account follow the [18F Snippet Standards for Website Analytics directions](https://github.com/18F/analytics-standards#18f-snippet-standards-for-website-analytics).

### Can I give access to a project's analytics to a client?

Yes, please!  Not only can you, but you should!

### How do I give access to a project's analytics to a client?

 In order to grant them access, we need to know what email address they want to use. If it is not a gmail (or google apps) email address, then they need to first go to google.com/analytics and create an account there using their preferred email address.

Then post in `#g-analytics` on Slack the email addresses of the client staff who you want to give access.  If you're not the project lead, make sure they are aware by cc'ing them in the slack post.

They will be given `Collaborate` and `Read & Analyze` permissions specific only to their project and will receive an email notification.

It is incumbent on the project team to track when analytics access should be removed. If a partner moves on and should no longer have access, the 18F team needs to contact #g-analytics on Slack and specify that access should be rescinded.

_Note that we are not currently in a position to grant access to Digital Analytics Program data to 3rd parties._
